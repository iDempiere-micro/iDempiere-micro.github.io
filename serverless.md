# Serverless in the [iDempiere micro](https://idempiere-micro.github.io/) microservices
[Serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) brings a lot of advanteges to the traditional concepts.
Together with the ERPs becoming a commodity, it can help to setup easily the [iDempiere micro](https://idempiere-micro.github.io/) microservices
for a new frontend e-shop.

Currently, the [iDempiere micro](https://idempiere-micro.github.io/) microservices are divided into smaller parts, but those are
still too big to be considered serverless lambdas. The first example of a part small enough to be wrapped inside of a serverless 
function is the [iDempiere Session micro service](https://github.com/iDempiere-micro/idempiere-micro-session-core). 
The lambda is yet to be released and this is planned in the Q1 2019.
