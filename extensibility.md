# Extensibility

The [iDempiere](http://www.idempiere.org/) is already very flexible and extensible. In [iDempiere micro](https://idempiere-micro.github.io/)
we allow you to extend the libraries even more:

- we stricly use interfaces for parameters and as a return types
- we try to keep the modules or libraries as uncoupled as possible
- we use IoC and Dependency Injection to allow the actual implementation to be specified later at the final microservice
