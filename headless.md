# Headless serverless [iDempiere micro](https://idempiere-micro.github.io/) microservices
The traditional applications contain all the parts:

- the database
- the middleware, business logic or how you want to call it
- the user interface

Recently, a need for a different type of application arised. These applications are usually serving their content to to not human beings, but another application. We can take e.g. content management systems as an example of the application that used to serve mainly the content to the website visitors, but now in the headless variant it serves the content to custom built frontend applications that do better job than the universal content management systems.

We follow the same principle with [iDempiere micro](https://idempiere-micro.github.io/) microservices and concentrate mainly on the backend part providing the custom build frontend applications (e.g. e-shops, POSes, vertical industry specific systems) a solid foundation of the authentication, customer data, accounting and invoicing.
